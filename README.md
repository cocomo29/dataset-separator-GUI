<p align="center">a python GUI that separates attributes of a dataset. <p/>

# Setup
- Download/Clone the repo.
- Install the requirements by running `pip install -r Requirements.txt` command in your downloaded/cloned directory.
- tweak `new` function in line 4 and `dowork` function in line 27 of [main.py](main.py) according to your dataset and you are good to go!

I designed this GUI for a project related to the **EnergyCallCenter**. If you want to customize it for your own purposes, you can simply replace the logo.png file in the assets folder and modify some text in main.py. The GUI should be easy to adapt to your specific needs. </br></br>
